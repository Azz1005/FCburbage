 <h1>Club History</h1>
    <p>
      FC Burbage was formed in the summer of 2011 by three coaches wanting to
      create an environment where children can have fun, get some exercise, make
      new friends and learn to love the nation’s national sport at a pace that’s
      right for them. Having spent three years coaching locally, from ‘Minis’
      through to Under 7 level and having witnessed first-hand the ‘pushy’ and
      sometimes extreme lengths some parents would go to when they believed
      their child to be the next Wayne Rooney – Rupert Newman, Jason Lee and
      Phil Stockton decided to set up their own club in Burbage for Under 8’s
      (of which their sons are all a part). This was driven in part by the lack
      of provision for children’s football in the village and in part by the
      interest they received when they shared the idea not least from Burbage
      Parish Council who supported by providing an area for training and
      matches. ”
    </p>

    <p>
      “There is rightly a lot of ‘red tape’ to contend with when you are trying
      to set up anything that provides a service for children, whether that be
      background checks, insurances, coaching qualifications through to funding
      for basic equipment and beyond so you’ve just got to have the courage of
      your convictions and be prepared for a few setbacks along the way when you
      set up a new club – but stick with it, it’s well worth it” says Phil
      Stockton one of three founding Dads
    </p>

    <p>
      ….and stick with it they did. Having held their first training session on
      20 August 2011 only five weeks after having the idea to set up their own
      club, the Dads reached their target number of children within two weeks
      and have a growing waiting list. Jason Lee insists “it is a nice problem
      to have and who knows what the set up may look like in a few years time,
      but for now we’ll concentrate on doing a good job for the children who
      have signed up and take it from there”.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Under 8’s will have two sides this season and will concentrate on
      playing friendlies against other local clubs before looking to join a
      league next season. Rupert Newman the third founding Dad points out that ”
      just because the club places an emphasis on fun doesn’t mean that when it
      comes to matches we’re not competitive, however winning at all costs is
      not the primary motivation, if we do, great, if not it’s no big deal. In
      children’s football it tends to be the parents who remember the result
      longer than the children and if we are to ever reach the dizzy heights of
      winning major championships at international level in this country we have
      to create an environment where kids can experiment and learn without fear
      of constant criticism and interference. That starts with everyone at grass
      roots level taking responsibility for their piece of the jigsaw and for us
      that’s FC Burbage”.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the summer of 2012, the club launched FC Burbage Minis – for children
      in school years Reception and Year 1. This decision was easy said Rupert,
      “We’ve established a system and have stability from the original group of
      players. It is important that we can provide the same enjoyable and safe
      experience to a new crop of aspiring footballers”. Jason then added that
      the now under 9s will be the leading age group, setting an example for the
      younger players and I share the same vision as with Rupert and Phil that
      our journey does not end here. The Minis of today will become the U7s of
      tomorrow and so the club will blossom”.
